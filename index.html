						We are living in a knowledge era with lots of data and info surrounding us, thanks to internet based and mobile technologies. In my youth, the resources for information were limited to books and encyclopedia. I remember, especially when I was in university, there was one book for a lesson and I had to understand any subject from couple of pages describing that subject. So, I was a student begging for more information, explanation and exercises. But, nowadays, I see that the problem has been changed to filtering and using the info that is available. I like it and I want to learn and learn to maximum satisfaction.

Being an electrical and electronics engineer, I worked for couple of companies before I started up my own business. My team has worked on electrical engineering project, automation, supervision, commissioning and start up of plants for more than 10 years. I have recent interest in data science and deep learning. As hobby, I follow up a phd program in Dokuz Eylul University. It is for diagnosis and prediction of some illnesses by use of deep learning algorithms and based on data.
